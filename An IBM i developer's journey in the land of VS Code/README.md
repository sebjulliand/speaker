- Open streamfiles
- Change the working directory

### Dive deeper!
Aside from the usual streamfile actions (create/move/copy/delete), the IFS browser offers some useful features:
- Download multiple files or folder (select and right-click)
- Upload from your local file explorer using drag'n'drop
- Move/copy using drag'n'drop
- Compare with various items

## Code for IBM i Actions
Actions in Code for IBM i is a highly customizable feature. It lets you define and run 5250 or shell commands on various items.

Through this walkthrough, you'll learn how to:
- Access the actions
- Create or edit actions
- Run the actions

### Dive deeper!
[Click here](https://codefori.github.io/docs/developing/actions/) to check out the related documentation section.

- Define [command profiles](https://codefori.github.io/docs/settings/profiles) to customize actions execution context
- Each command line starting with `?` will open an input to let you change the command before it gets executed
- You can define you own action prompt, using text fields and dropdown lists!

#### Text field example
Syntax: `PARM(${id|Label})`
```
OUTFILE(${outfile|Output file})
```

## Code for IBM i Tips
Through this walkthrough, you'll learn how to:
- Compare source editors
- Run SQL using the Db2 for i extension
- Search for source members

### Dive deeper!
[Check out this section](https://codefori.github.io/docs/tips/protect/) to learn more about preventing source code from being modified, using protected modes.

# 3. Dive into the Db2 for i extension
## Get started
The `Db2 for i` extension allows you to run SQL queries right from VS Code. It also includes Visual Explain and supports Notebook.

Open the [Db2 for i guide](https://codefori.github.io/docs/extensions/db2i/#executing-statements) and follow each steps starting from the **Executing statements** chapter.

## Try the examples
The extension comes with a set of SQL examples. To browse the examples, open the Db2 for i view container and then expand the `Examples` view.

## Notebooks
Db2 Notebooks are documents that contain a mix of rich Markdown and executable code snippets (SQL, CL and shell), and accompanying rich output. These are all separated into distinct cells and can be interleaved in any order.

The Db2 for i extension comes with its own set of sample Notebooks.

![](assets/sameplnotebooks.png)

You can run several types of queries in a Notebook. Try these few examples:
### SQL
List the total size of each object types in a library.
```sql
Select objtype || ' (' || count(objtype) || ')' as label, Sum(OBJSIZE) / 1024 as "Size" FROM TABLE(QSYS2.OBJECT_STATISTICS('QGPL', '*ALL')) Group By objtype Order by "Size" Desc
```
Turn it into a bar chart!
```sql
-- chart: bar
-- title: QGPL objects size
-- y: Kilobytes
-- hideStatement: true
Select objtype || ' (' || count(objtype) || ')' as label, Sum(OBJSIZE) / 1024 as "Size" FROM TABLE(QSYS2.OBJECT_STATISTICS('QGPL', '*ALL')) Group By objtype Order by "Size" Desc
```

Fetch a dad joke! ðŸ˜‚
```sql
select json_value(response_message, '$.joke' returning varchar(5000)) as joke from table ( qsys2.http_get_verbose('https://icanhazdadjoke.com', json_object( 'headers': json_object('accept': 'application/json' ))));
```

Open a fortune cookie ðŸ¤”
```sql
select trim(replace(replace(RESPONSE_MESSAGE, '\n',' '), '\t', ' ')) fortune from table ( qsys2.http_get_verbose('https://api.justyy.workers.dev/api/fortune'));
```

### Shell
Fetch a dad joke again! (requires `curl` and `jq` to be installed)
```shell
curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://icanhazdadjoke.com | jq ".joke"
```  

### CL
Display the current library list
```
DSPLIBL
```
